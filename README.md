XCTools
-------

A set of python modules & class created to build applications around NOTAM & Airspace information.

The primary target is the paragliding community but other recreational flight activities might find our XCTools usefull.

XCTools are used in the backend of our website [FlyXC.Tools](http://www.flyxc.tools/) but are generic enough to be usefull for other type of application and services.
